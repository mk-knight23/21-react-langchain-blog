# Design System: 21-react-langchain-blog

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows an **AI Research / Technical Engineering** aesthetic. It uses a deep "Synthetic Void" background (Slate-950) with "Emerald-Teal" (#10b981 to #2dd4bf) accents, focusing on clarity, technical precision, and modern typography.

## Design Patterns
-   **Technical Dispatches**: Large, legible article cards (P-10) with semi-transparent backgrounds and subtle internal borders (white/5).
-   **AI Glints**: Strategic use of the Sparkles icon and emerald-teal gradient glows to denote AI-powered content.
-   **Engineering Badges**: High-contrast, small-caps categorization labels with 10% emerald opacity for specialized scannability.
-   **Newsletter Ceramic**: Technical input fields with 5% white opacity and high-contrast emerald focus rings.

## Color Palette
-   **Synthetic Void**: Slate-950 (#020617)
-   **LangChain Emerald**: Primary Accent (#10b981)
-   **Research Teal**: Secondary Accent (#22d3ee)
-   **Diagnostic Slate**: Muted Core (#475569)

## Interaction Design
-   **Dispatch Reveal**: 20px vertical motion reveals for article cards to simulate a technical feed initialization.
-   **Keyword Kinetics**: 1.0s scale/reveal transitions for primary hero headings.
-   **Lab Feedback**: 1px border-emerald-500/50 transitions on card hover to indicate active research focus.
