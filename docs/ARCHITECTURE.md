# Architecture: 21-react-langchain-blog

## Overview
A technical AI engineering blog platform built with React 19 and Vite 6. It integrates LangChain for backend AI orchestration (Python/Flask) and features a high-fidelity frontend for dispatching technical research on LLM patterns, prompt engineering, and RAG architectures.

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Backend**: Python / Flask / LangChain (for AI generation features)

## Core Logic
-   **AI Dispatcher**: Reactive card system for showcasing deep technical articles with categorization and read-time metrics.
-   **Technical RAG Stack**: Conceptual layout for discussing retrieval-augmented generation patterns.
-   **AI_CHAIN Runtime**: Real-time interface simulation for LangChain-driven workflows.
-   **Newsletter Orchestration**: High-fidelity subscription layer for technical community engagement.

## Performance
-   Native React 19 rendering for sub-millisecond interaction latency during content filtering.
-   Tailwind v4 JIT engine for zero-runtime CSS footprint.
-   GPU-accelerated gradient reveals and backdrop blurs for a premium "Research Lab" visual experience.
